/*!
 * \brief Interface between a single "master" application instance and multiple "slave" instances that automatically exit again.
 *
 * Implements a virtual "bus" for communicating requests from multiple application instances to execute different
 * tasks in a main ("master") instance instead of the instance that sends the request ("slave"). The bus is based
 * on shared memory segments and is initialized by init(). The first of all instances that calls init() initially
 * creates the shared memory segments and becomes the master instance (see also isMaster()), which has to control
 * the bus and process the requests (see listen()). If a master instance is already running then init() simply attaches
 * to the bus and the instance becomes a slave instance. A slave instance can send requests to create a new Report in
 * the master instance (see sendNewReport()) or to open an existing Report in the master instance (see sendOpenReport()).
 *
 * Note: If a slave instance does not need to send further requests (or a master instance does not want to be
 * one but rather exit) but still has to keep running for some reason then it can use detach() to detach from
 * the bus before exiting in order not to be wrongly recognized as master instance while it is still running.
